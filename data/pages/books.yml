    summary: >-
      “I couldn’t let myself be vulnerable. Not enough to express my true

      emotions, if I could even remember what they were. I was desperate.

      Desperate to know the story of my father’s death, desperate to forget… I inhaled an oxycodone. That was better. No pain. Or,

      it was there, I suppose, but it had a far-off quality to it.”


      In his authorial debut, Matthew Bocchi delves into life after 9/11—and how the death of his father was just the beginning of a tumultuous drug-fueled path towards peace and serenity. After multiple attempts, Matt finally gets sober and identifies the void he had been trying to fill all along. His honest and emotionally raw voice grips readers throughout his entire journey—encouraging them to root for him along the way. Sway is a deeply vulnerable memoir about a man’s redemption and triumph over loss, obsession, abuse, and addiction—a story that needs to be told, but more importantly, heard.
